# Inference Workshop Lecture Notes

This repository contains my lecture notes for the [PyCBC Inference workshop](https://github.com/gwastro/PyCBCInferenceWorkshopMay2019).

The lecture notes are written in Markdown and converted to beamer files using the [MultiMarkdown](http://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/) tool. The
lecture notes use the beamer [m theme](https://github.com/matze/mtheme). To
compile the notes a modified version of [peg-multimarkdown-latex-support](https://github.com/mattpitkin/peg-multimarkdown-latex-support) is required. You should also have the [Fira Sans](http://www.carrois.com/fira-4-1/) font installed.

I take the responsibility for any errors in the notes. If you have any corrections/suggestions please let me know.
